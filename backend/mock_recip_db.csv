Whole-Wheat Cinnamon Rolls with Honey Frosting,"1- 1/2 cup Hot Water. 13 cups Olive Oil. 13 cups Honey. 2 teaspoons Sea Salt. 1 whole Egg. 6 cups Whole Wheat Flour, Divided. 2 Tablespoons Lecithin (optional). 1 Tablespoon Instant Yeast. 1- 1/2 cup Brown Sugar Or Sucanat. 1 Tablespoon Ground Cinnamon. 1 dash Ground Nutmeg. 6 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter, melted. 1 cup Honey Granules. 2 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter, melted. 1/2 teaspoons Pure Vanilla Extract. 2 Tablespoons Milk. ","For the dough: In a large bowl, combine water, oil, honey, salt, and egg with a large wooden spoon. Stir in 2 cups of the flour and the lecithin. Add yeast and enough of the remaining flour (maybe more) to make a soft dough. Knead until smooth and elastic for about 5 minutes, adding more flour if too sticky. Let dough rise, covered in a large bowl, in a draft-free location, until double in size (this could take a couple of hours). Once dough has risen, make the filling by combining sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a small bowl. Add 6 tablespoons of melted butter directly into the bowl with the powder mixture and stir with whisk. Punch down dough and roll out into a 10x15-inch rectangle. Spread with the entire bowl of filling. Roll up the dough, starting with one of the long sides (so roll it up length wise) and cut roll into 12 equal slices. Place the slices, cut sides up, with sides touching, in a greased 13 x 9-inch baking pan. Let it rise again, in a draft-free location, until double in size. (This could take about an hour or more). Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes. While the rolls are baking, make the frosting, by placing the honey granules in a blender. Pulse for a minute or two, then transfer the honey granules to a small bowl and whisk in 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Add vanilla and enough milk to thin to desired consistency. Whisk until smooth. Spread icing on rolls immediately after they come out of oven. *You can also substitute your own favorite cream cheese or powdered sugar frosting! Please note: Weather plays a huge role in the rising of bread. On humid or rainy days, expect your dough to take longer to rise. The lecithin powder is a dough emulsifier made from soybeans, giving the bread a soft, smooth texture. You dont need to use it to make this bread, but it is recommended. Sucanat is a dried sweetener (granule form) made from the juice of sugar cane. It is a healthier substitute for refined brown sugars. The honey granules are a healthier substitute for the refined white sugars.

Mix water, bouillion cubes, salt, and potato in a sauce pan and boil over medium heat until the potatoes just start to soften. Add vegetables to the pan and boil an additional 5 minutes or so, then reduce heat to simmer and very gradually stir in corn starch. Gauge starch until mixture has a medium gravy texture or as you would desire for pie filling. Finally, add meat and simmer without stirring while you make the crust. Either add water or corn starch to adjust texture if necessary. Crust:. In a large mixing bowl, blend flour, salt, and garlic/onion (if used). Dice vegetable shortening and butter to small pieces and distribute evenly in flour. Either cut in or with an electric mixer, mix shortening and butter into flour to obtain a flaky granular mixture. With a large spoon, break ice cubes in your hand and distribute the chips throughout the flour mixture. Blend ice in until fully incorporated and melted into the flour. Split the mixture into 2 sections sufficient to make a crust and covering. Flour a flat surface and roll sections with a floured rolling pin until good size for pie pan and cover. For a nice touch, slice the cover section into 1"" strips to make a weave or criss-cross patterned top. Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly grease a pie tin (or dish) and form the pie crust into the tin, leaving loose edges all the way around the tin. Rub the olive oil inside the entire crust as it sits in the tin. Recheck the consistency of the filling and adjust as necessary. Pour the filling into the pie crust, leaving enough room to add the covering. Lay a full covering (or weave strips) of crust across the top of the pie. Pinch the edges where the upper and lower crust meet to form a seal all the way around the pie. Once sealed, trim excess crust to edge of pie tin. Knife holes into the crust cover to relieve pressure during cooking. Brush milk thoroughlly and generously across entire upper crust of pie, then place in oven. Cook for about 30 minutes or until crust is golden brown.

","Heat a large dry skillet over medium heat and add quinoa, stirring to toast, until it crackles and becomes a bit brownish and aromatic. Transfer to a fine sieve and rinse under cold running water. Drain. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, stirring often, about 2 or 3 minutes. Add chiles and garlic. Cook stirring for 30 seconds. Add the quinoa and broth to the onion mixture. Bring to a simmer.

Add toasted pepitas, cilantro, scallions, lime juice and salt to the quinoa. Fluff with a fork and stir gently to mix. NOTE: Pepitas are hulled pumpkin seeds. They are somewhat green and may be found in health-food stores or Latin markets. If you can't find pepitas, I suppose shelled raw sunflower kernels would be a good substitute in this recipe.

It's easy to go from brown to burnt really quickly, so keep an eye on them. When done, remove from the heat quickly and put into a different dish that is cool.
